## REEL

Hello, this is my submission for the REEL take home challenge.

My approach to this feature was primarily based on readability and scalability. As a list like this would eventually get bigger, I wanted to allow the user to be able to control what information they wanted to see with as few clicks as possible. Even with a small list and a small amount of data per item, it could potentially get overwhelming seeing all the data at once on screen. I implemented a collapse/expand feature so that the user could control what is displayed easier. I kept the ability to toggle status even when collapsed for better ease of use. As the list gets bigger, including a fixed nav bar to sort/search the list seemed appropriate, especially if the entire list is expanded.

I decided to add the calculator feature as a way to easily total up different parts of the data. For example, as a user I would want to quickly find out how much I currently have saved in total, or how much money is left remaining for all purchases. I wanted to give the user as much flexibility in what they could calculate as possible, while still remaining useful.

I enjoyed working on this project very much and look forward to speaking with you!
